        <p>Cuiyh built the U2Boost app as a free application. This <strong>SERVICE</strong> is provided by Cuiyh at no cost and is intended for use as-is.</p>
        
        <p>This page informs users of my policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information for anyone choosing to use this Service.</p>
        
        <p>By using this Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. The Personal Information collected is used solely for providing and improving the Service.
